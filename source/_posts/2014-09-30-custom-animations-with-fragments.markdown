desc: "In the past few months, I have been working on developing an Android application from the ground up. This app named after the name of the company, Capitaine Train, can be downloaded on the Google Play Store. Capitaine Train - which can literally be translated as “Captain Train” in English - is a 3-year-old startup born from a simple truth: getting train tickets in Europe was a pain in the ass. We, at Capitaine Train, aim to revolutionize the way people travel all around Europe by simplifying the overall train experience. The release of the Android application clearly represented an important step forward in this direction."
